Perceptron training is one of the simplest supervised training method used for binary classification tasks. It works by finding linear decision boundary that separates two classes of data.

OBJECTIVE:

The objective is to find a Margin Perceptron i.e. a hyperplane that separates the brand 'A' from those labeled as brand 'B' and same for the other brands which are 'B' and 'C'.

Also we would compute the margins from the linear classifiers.

We will also find the fusion rule for classifying the brands 'A', 'B' and 'C' using the fusion rule given as:-

s1 = (49.29, 24.82, 21.68, 2.76, 0.52, 1.47, 3.00)

s2 = (30.95, 19.81, 42.28, 5.11, 1.67, 1.85, 4.67)

s3 = (50.33, 13.28, 28.43, 3.58, 1.03, 4.38, 3.27)
